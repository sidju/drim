Difficult parts:

Assets as a concept requires modifications where additions were the norm. Less data security and more difficult coding.
--Assets allow multiple entries. They are summed by a view.--
--Assets do not allow subtractions. They are used by actions being created.--

Loans can be created and taken out.
--More complicated coding is required to avoid errors.--

Loans need to be cashed out without instantly returning the influence to the owner. A buffering table that is updated on new rounds is needed.
--ConsumedInfluence is created for this purpose--

Door openings require an entirely separate pending, denied, active chain.
--One has been created. The mess of views needed is not yet done.--

Investments can resolve with a delay and should then be shown on the next new round after that delay has passed.
--Visible boolean flag is set on first new round after Time. When Visible is set all other parts take effect and it is visible to the player.--


What would be simpler?:

Investments are active immediately when approved.
Door openings are abolished (and along with it the separation between assets and influences that further complicates loans and transfers).
Loans last one round only.
