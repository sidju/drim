TODO:

Move code from routes.rs into handlers/mod.rs

Separate the roles database interaction from the handler, if database function isn't trivial

Database interactions are esentially trivial. Thus they could be inlined easily, but that
makes code reuse difficult if not impossible. As long as no database changes are made it
should be ok.


Create a universal error handler, that responds to any application error in a reasonable 
manner. (Redirect to login if unauthorised, pretty error pages if user did bad stuff, 500 if
something that shouldn't have happened happened.)
